abstract = {Nowadays mobile applications that require the interaction and collaboration of two or more users simultaneously are becoming more and more frequent, that is why to ensure high quality of these products, testers are adopting test automation techniques that can optimize their quality assurance process. In previous work we presented Kraken, a publicly available cross-device testing tool that enables a tester to write, run, and validate test scenarios that involve the interaction of two or more devices using APKs as input along with test scripts wrote using the Gherkin syntax. In this paper, we will extend on Kraken previous and new functionalities such as random GUI events, fake string generation and state XML snapshots of a displayed view.}
